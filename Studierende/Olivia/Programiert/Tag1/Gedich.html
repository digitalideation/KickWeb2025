<h1>
    Billy - James Blunt
</h1>

<h2>
    Billy's leaving today, <br>
    don't know where he's goin'<br>
Holds his head in disgrace, <br>
he can't escape the truth<br>
He knows the price that he's paid<br>
He admits that it's too late <br>
to admit that he's afraid<br>
Tomorrow comes, <br>
sorrow becomes his soul mate <br>
The damage is done, <br>
the prodigal son is too late<br>
Old doors are closed, <br>
but he's always open<br>
To relive time in his mind<br>
Oh, Billy
</h2>
